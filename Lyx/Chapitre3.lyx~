Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Large-scale complex scientific applications/workflow are executed and analyzed
 in multi-disciplinary areas of research such as astronomy and physics.
 The workflow contains a large number of mutually dependent tasks which
 are executed according to their dependency constraint.
 Due to dependency constraints, the child task can start its execution only
 when the parent task finishes its execution.
 A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is used to represent workflows.
 These workflows often have disparate requirements (such as storage and
 CPU) and constraints (dependency) that need to be accounted for during
 their execution

Workflow scheduling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the cloud environment, effective management of scientific workflows is
 the main challenge since there are numerous virtual machines and many user
 tasks that should be scheduled by considering dependencies and various
 objectives

\begin_layout Subsection
Definition of Task scheduling of scientific workflows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Task scheduling of scientific workflow is extremely important.
 Task scheduling algorithms are based on appropriate policies to deploy
 scientific workflow to the physical nodes in the cloud computing system.
 Because various physical nodes are heterogeneous and their running status
 is dynamically changed over time, at the same time, the system resources
 required by users and the request types of users are different, so the
 design of the scheduling algorithms of scientific workflow is complex in
 the cloud computing system.
 A bad scheduling policy can lead to a decline in system performance, a
 long time span of request feedback, a decrease in user satisfaction and
 a decrease in system throughput.
 In general, the goal of tasks scheduling of scientific workflow in the
 cloud environment is to optimize the allocation of scientific workflow,
 maximize user satisfaction and maximize the economic benefits of operators
 and minimize operating costs

\begin_layout Subsection
Scientific workflow scheduling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Workflow scheduling calls for high computation and communication costs,
 especially scientific workflows that have to do with areas such as astronomy
 and biology are among the most commonly used cloud applications.
 In cloud computing, a service provider provides users with various capacities
 at various costs.
 Usually, faster resources are more expensive than slower ones.
 Thus, the scheduler with varied resources for workflow will have different
 runtimes and costs; therefore, there will be various restrictions by the
 user.
 The time restriction guarantees that the workflow is done within the time
 specified by the user.
 The cost constraint guarantees that the cost does not exceed the budget
 established by the user.
 The optimal response will create a balance between these two criteria

Task scheduling types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Task scheduling can be categorized, as offline scheduling and online scheduling
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Offline scheduling which means the execution time is calculated and mapping
 tasks shall be examined at pre-scheduled times.
 This scheduling approach is static.
 This strategy helps us prepare a supply plan for tasks, allocate resources
 to them and then execute the tasks according to this supply plan
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "hard_optimization_mohammadzadeh2021energy"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Static scheduling generates a scheduling plan (SP) that allocates all executabl
e tasks to compute nodes before execution and the WMS strictly adheres to
 the scheduling plan throughout the duration of the scientific workflow
 execution.
 Since it is prior to execution, static scheduling generates little overhead
 during execution.
 It is efficient if the WMS can accurately predict the execution time of
 each task, when the execution environment varies little during workflow
 execution and when the WMS has sufficient information about the computing
 and storage capabilities of the corresponding computers.
 However, when the execution environment undergoes dynamic changes, it is
 very difficult to achieve load balance.
 Static task scheduling algorithms have two types of processor selection
 methods: 
\series bold
heuristic-based
\series default
 and 
\series bold
guided random search-based
\series default
.
 The heuristic-based method schedules tasks according to a predefined rule
 while the random search-based method schedules tasks randomly

\begin_layout Itemize
The second approach is online task scheduling, which means dynamic scheduling
 tasks, where one needs to use and consider available resources rather than
 operating time.
 The tasks will be performed without delay, using the available resources
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "hard_optimization_mohammadzadeh2021energy"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Dynamic scheduling produces scheduling plans that distribute and allocate
 executable tasks to compute nodes during workflow execution.
 This type of scheduling is suitable for scientific workflows, in which
 the workload of tasks is difficult to estimate, or for environments where
 computer capabilities vary greatly during execution.
 It should be noted that dynamic scheduling requires time to dynamically
 generate scheduling plans during execution.
 Dynamic scheduling algorithms can be based on queueing techniques in a
 publish/subscribe model with different strategies such as First In First
 Out (FIFO), adaptive, etc

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Cost
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The minimization of the execution cost or the respect of user-defined budget:
 for the user, reducing execution cost is of capital importance.
 Users sometimes have a cap on the amount of money spent on resources (i.e.
 budget).
 Minimizing execution costs and taking into account user-defined budgets
 in a scheduling strategy is crucial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Makespan
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The minimization of the execution time or the respect of user-defined deadline
 as in the case of the execution cost, execution time and deadline are of
 capital importance for cloud users.
 Therefore, scheduling strategies must strive to reduce the makespan while
 mapping workflow tasks on cloud resources and be aware of the user-defined
 deadline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Workload Maximization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The maximization of the workload aims at maximizing the amount of work done,
 that is, the number of workflows executed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Maximization of VM utilization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Idle time slots in provisioned VMs are deemed as a waste of money as they
 were paid for but not utilized and as a result, algorithms try to avoid
 them in their schedules.
 Minimizing idle time slots and maximizing the utilization of resources
 helps reduce execution costs as well as energy consumption, engraving profit
 to providers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Energy Consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current industries, organizations and governments are really concerned
 about the reduction of energy and to reduce the carbon footprint.
 For cloud computing providers, energy consumption reduction is key to upgrading
 their return on investment (ROI).
 Energy-efficient scheduling on the servers is one of the challenging problems
 in a dynamic environment such as the cloud domain for reducing energy consumpti
on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Reliability Awareness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scheduling algorithms considering reliability as part of their objectives
 must put mechanisms in place to ensure that the workflow execution is completed
 within the users’ QoS constraints even if resource or task failures occur.
 Or simply minimize possible failure during workflow execution.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reducing energy consumption in a cloud data center has recently become a
 major concern for many researchers.
 This is because the cloud environment has become a trusted platform that
 individuals, organizations and the government rely on to conduct business.
 So, if the energy consumption in the cloud data center is not reduced,
 it will have a direct or indirect impact on all the stakeholders.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A VM allocation model has been proposed (see Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "VM_allocation_model"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

), which aims at managing cloud resources to reduce energy consumption in
 the cloud data center.
 In workflow scheduling, a scheduler is developed to assign the right tasks
 to the right VMs to improve the scheduling objectives.
 However, the biggest challenge is how to manage the cloud resources effectively
 to achieve the set goals.
 This is because cloud users turn in a large number of requests that require
 resources to schedule.
 This becomes even more obvious if these requests (tasks) are to be scheduled
 within certain deadlines.
 This challenge can be well managed if the scheduler is implemented with
 a well-defined resource management plan.

 This group of tasks is less critical compared to HCT, but more critical

 tasks.
 This category of tasks does not need to be processed on high-speed VMs

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Definition 3: task's deadline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every workflow task has a deadline.
 A deadline is a time-based scheduling constraint that requires a workflow
 task to be scheduled within a specified time period.
 These deadlines are set by users.
 A task can have a shorter/earliest deadline or a longer deadline.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A shorter/earliest deadline task is a task that is close to its specified
 scheduling time.
 Such tasks are assigned the highest priorities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tasks with long deadlines are tasks that do not require higher priority.
 This is because such tasks are not close to their predefined deadlines
 and therefore can be assigned to resources after the higher priority tasks
 (shorter deadline tasks) have been scheduled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, each task must be executed before the specified deadline.
 If the execution of a workflow task 𝑇 exceeds its deadline, it means that
 the deadline constraint set by the user has been violated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As shown in Figure
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "VM_allocation_model"
plural "false"

\end_inset

, we have four workflow tasks that have arrived and are queued to be mapped
 to VMs.
 The arrived tasks are 𝑤𝑡1, 𝑤𝑡2, 𝑤𝑡3 and 𝑤𝑡4.
 We also have three types of VMs (𝑉𝑀
\begin_inset Formula $_{𝐻𝐸𝐶}$
\end_inset

, 𝑉𝑀
\begin_inset Formula $_{𝑀𝐸𝐶}$
\end_inset

 and 𝑉𝑀
\begin_inset Formula $_{𝐿𝐸𝐶}$
\end_inset

).
 These tasks have different deadlines and we need to map them to VMs based
 on their deadlines.
 𝑤𝑡1 belongs to the HCT group because its deadline is 2 min, which is too
 tight and if it is not allocated immediately, it might miss its deadline.
 To prevent 𝑤𝑡1 from missing its deadline, we quickly mapped it to VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{HEC}$
\end_inset

.
 The reason is that VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{HEC}$
\end_inset

 is a high-speed VM that can finish executing 𝑤𝑡1 before or on its deadline.
 The next task closer to its deadline is 𝑤𝑡4 and since VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{HEC}$
\end_inset

 is currently executing 𝑤𝑡1, we mapped 𝑤𝑡4 to VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{MEC}$
\end_inset

.
 The projections show that by the time 𝑤𝑡1 will meet its deadline, 𝑤𝑡3 will
 have 3 min left to also meet its deadline (5min-2 min).
 Therefore, 𝑤𝑡3 is classified as an HCT at that time and if there is no
 other HCT in the waiting queue at that time, then 𝑤𝑡3 is mapped to VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{HEC}$
\end_inset

 and 𝑤𝑡2 is mapped to VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{MEC}$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{LEC}$
\end_inset

 is idle.
 The idle VM is turned off or put into safe mode to save power.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of workflow scheduling is to find the best optimal solution from
 various optimization methods that can give good results for the optimization
 problem.
 The optimization problem can be a single-objective or multi-objective optimizat
ion problem.
 Single-objective optimization involves optimizing only one scheduling objective
, such as execution makespan or cost.
 Multi-objective optimization, on the other hand, focuses on optimizing
 two or more objectives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem of multi-objective optimization varies from user to user and
 must be managed accordingly.
 Some users may want a reduced execution makespan and execution cost while
 ensuring that QoS constraints are not violated, others may want to reduce
 energy consumption and task execution time while ensuring effective utilization
 of cloud resources.
 In this work, a multi-objective scheduling problem has been considered.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider a workflow application as DAG.
 It is modeled with data dependencies representing precedence constraints
 between tasks.
 These tasks represent requests from the users to be processed on cloud
 resources (VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{HEC}$
\end_inset

, (VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{MEC}$
\end_inset

, VM
\begin_inset Formula $_{LEC}$
\end_inset

) so that the energy consumption, makespan and execution cost are reduced
 without violating the deadlines of the tasks.
 However, reducing energy consumption increases the execution cost of scientific
 workflow applications.
 This is because energy consumption and execution cost are conflicting metrics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our goal is to reduce the energy consumption, makespan and execution cost
 of workflow tasks with dependency constraints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Definition 4: total energy consumed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we aim at improving resource management to reduce energy consumption
 in cloud data centers at a lower cost without violating scheduling constraints,
 energy consumption can be derived from the next equation.
 Here, TE
\begin_inset Formula $_{E}$
\end_inset

 is the total energy consumed for executing workflows, ED
\begin_inset Formula $_{E}$
\end_inset

is the energy consumed for transferring all data and the sum of energy consumed
 for scheduling all tasks on all VM.

Energy optimization problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scientific workflows are the constitution of distinct tasks with complex
 dependencies.
 Resource provisioning and the order in which workflow tasks are executed
 are challenging problems.
 The inefficient utilization of resources while executing the workflows
 wastes a tremendous number of resources.
 The inefficient utilization of resources increases the number of unused
 provisioned resources.
 These unused resources increase energy consumption without performing any
 useful operation.
 Performance can be increased by efficient resource provisioning.
 An energy-efficient scheduling algorithm can be used to manage the resources
 that are required by the task while executing these scientific workflow
 tasks.
 In the literature, numerous workflow scheduling algorithms have been proposed.
 These scheduling algorithms focus on diminishing makespan and cost with
 inadequate resources.
 The selection and designing of a competent and operative workflow scheduling
 algorithm are also challenging tasks.
 The energy-aware scheduling algorithm must be selected which can provide
 a proper resource from the offered resources which are efficient enough
 to complete the workflow tasks within their deadline constriction and it
 can decrease the energy consumption

Hard optimization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A multi-objective optimization approach is suggested here for scientific
 workflow task-scheduling problems in cloud computing.
 More frequently, scientific workflow involves a large number of tasks.
 It requires more resources to perform all these tasks.
 Such a large amount of computing power can be supported only by cloud infrastru
cture.
 To implement complex science applications, more computing energy is expended,
 so the use of cloud virtual machines in an energy-saving way is essential.
 However, even today, it is a difficult challenge to conduct a scientific
 workflow in an energy-aware cloud platform.
 The hardness of this problem increases even more with several contradictory
 goals.
 Most of the existing research does not consider the essential characteristic
 of the cloud and significant issues, such as energy variation and throughput
 besides makespan and cost

\begin_layout Standard
The Parallel bi-objective hybrid genetic algorithm (PBHGA) is a parallel
 evolutionary algorithm for solving multi-objective optimization problems.
 It combines several optimization techniques including genetic algorithm
 (GA) and local search.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The algorithm works by using an initial population of random solutions.
 Individuals in this population are rated based on their goals and their
 fitness is assessed using a fitness function.
 Then, individuals are selected for breeding using a rank-based or roulette
 selection operator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reproduction is done using genetic operators such as mutation and crossover.
 Mutation involves modifying a single gene of the individual while crossbreeding
 involves creating new individuals by combining the characteristics of two
 different parents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process of selection and reproduction is repeated for several generations
 until an optimal solution is found.
 During the whole optimization process, PBHGA maintains a population of
 solutions to efficiently explore the search space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The parallel approach of the algorithm helps to speed up the optimization
 process by running multiple search tasks simultaneously on different processors.
 It also makes it possible to efficiently explore regions of the search
 space that would otherwise be difficult to reach.

 the diversity of the population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These algorithms all use an evolutionary approach to optimize multiple goals
 at the same time.
 Candidate solutions are evaluated against several optimization criteria
 and the best solutions are selected for replication.
 The algorithms then use crossover and mutation operators to generate a
 new population of candidate solutions.
 The process is repeated until solutions of sufficient quality are found.

 The algorithm is used for solving various optimization problems, including
 function optimization and feature selection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Improved EASLA algorithm is an enhanced version of EASLA, which incorporates
 some modifications to improve its performance.
 The key modifications include the incorporation of a mutation operator
 to explore the search space and the use of a dynamic population size to
 adapt to the search problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic idea behind EASLA is to simulate the hunting behavior of antlions,
 which use a combination of ambush and trap techniques to capture their
 prey.
 In EASLA, the antlion represents the best solution found so far and the
 ants represent potential solutions in the search space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The algorithm starts by randomly generating a population of ants and placing
 them in the search space.
 The ants move toward the antlion based on a probability function that takes
 into account both the distance to the antlion and the local attraction
 of the area.
 The antlion is then updated to the best solution found among the ants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Improved EASLA algorithm extends this basic framework by introducing
 a mutation operator that randomly modifies the position of some ants, which
 can help to explore new regions of the search space.
 The population size is also dynamically adjusted during the search to balance
 exploration and exploitation.

 ECS+Idle uses a greedy approach to find an initial schedule and then applies
 a genetic algorithm to optimize the schedule by exploiting the idle time
 of processors.
 Both ECS and ECS+Idle have been shown to be effective in reducing energy
 consumption in computing systems while maintaining performance requirements.
 These algorithms have been applied to various scheduling problems, including
 task scheduling on heterogeneous systems, scheduling in cloud computing
 environments and scheduling in real-time systems

ESPA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ESPA (Enhanced Scheduling Priority Algorithm) is a scheduling algorithm
 used in real-time systems that aims to improve the scheduling performance
 compared to traditional priority-based scheduling algorithms such as Earliest
 Deadline First (EDF) or Rate Monotonic (RM) scheduling.
 The ESPA algorithm works by assigning a scheduling priority to each task
 based on its execution history and the current system state.
 The algorithm uses a set of rules to determine the priority of a task

There is a variety of problem formulations and corresponding algorithm types
 that tackle the problem of workflow energy-aware scheduling for Cloud computing
 envirenment, including machine learning (with reinforcement and supervised
 learning), dynamic programming, fuzzy logic, integer programming, randomized
 algorithms, evolutionary algorithms, constraint programming, and others.

Most optimization goals involve metrics such as execution time/makespan,
 energy.
 A limited number of works specifically consider costs, performance, reliability
 and folt-tolerance.
