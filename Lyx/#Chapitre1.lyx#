Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Workflows are a systematic way for describing and executing a series of
 computational and data manipulation steps, or tasks, in a specific application
 domain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter, we present workflow and the Workflow Management System
 (WfMS) with its architecture.
 We will also talk about scientific workflows, their life cycle and their
 types.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Workflow definition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The WfMC is a consortium formed to define standards for the interoperability
 of workflow management systems.
 WfMC define workflow as following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

Workflow is the sequence of tasks, steps and decisions that need to be followed
 to complete a specific process.
 It can be thought of as a set of instructions that describe how a process
 should be performed, including the order in which tasks are to be completed,
 who is responsible for performing each task and what should happen next
 based on the outcome of each task.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center

\shape italic
Workflows can be used to automate a wide range of business processes, such
 as invoicing, order fulfillment, human resources and project management.
 The goal of a workflow is to make sure that tasks are completed in the
 correct order and by the right people and to ensure that the process is
 efficient and accurate.

A software application that is designed to help organizations automate and
 manage their business processes.
 A WfMS allows an organization to define and implement a workflow – a series
 of tasks, steps and decisions – that need to be followed to complete a
 specific process.
 The system can then be used to track the progress of the workflow, manage
 the flow of information and documents and ensure that tasks are completed
 in the correct order and by the right people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
A WfMS can be used to automate a wide range of business processes, such
 as invoicing, order fulfillment, human resources and project management.
 It can also be used to integrate different systems, such as email, calendar
 and customer relationship management (CRM) software.
 WfMS allows you to streamline the process and make it more efficient, reduce
 errors and delays and give you real-time visibility into the status of
 your processes, also it’s common to have a built-in reporting and analytics
 tools to measure the performance of the process

Workflow engine architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Workflows are compositions of tasks (also referred to as activities) by
 means of causal or data dependencies that are carried out on a computer.
 They are executed on a workflow management system (WfMS).
 A workflow that utilizes Web services (WSs) as implementations of tasks
 is usually called service composition.
 Web services are the most prominent implementation of the service oriented
 architecture (SOA).
 Web Service technology is an approach to provide and request services in
 distributed environments independent of programming languages, platforms
 and operating systems.
 It is applied in a very wide range of applications where integration of
 heterogeneous systems is a must

\begin_layout Standard
The WfMC has published an architectural Reference Model which provides the
 general architectural framework for the work of the WfMC.
 It identifies “interfaces” covering, broadly, five areas of functionality
 between a workflow management system and its environment

\begin_layout Standard
There are 5 interfaces
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 which are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Interface 1 Web Service (process definition tools)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 1
\begin_inset Formula $^{st}$
\end_inset

 interface service provides the link between the tools designed for creating
 and modifying workflow definitions and the workflow enactment service.
 It controls the system connection.
 In addition, it inquiries the workflow for process definitions and resource
 classifications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Interface 2 (workflow client applications) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Through the 2
\begin_inset Formula $^{nd}$
\end_inset

 interface service, users have access to a work list handler service and
 enactment services.
 In addition, the service produces states of cases and work items.
 The states are also controlled through this service (i.e.
 start, interruption, hang-up, executing, etc).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Interface 3 (invoked applications)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When some tasks of a process need to invoke an application outside of the
 workflow engine, they directly activate the workflow enactment service
 through the 3
\begin_inset Formula $^{rd}$
\end_inset

 interface service and open interactive applications with the current work
 item of the work list handler.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Interface 4 (other workflow enactment services)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interoperability and communication between workflows become the bottleneck
 to solve with the recommendations and standards of WfMC.
 The 4th interface service handles the basic operations to exchange between
 autonomous workflow systems.
 Through this interface, workflows transfer cases, resources and work items.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Interface 5 (administration and monitoring tools)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 5
\begin_inset Formula $^{th}$
\end_inset

 interface manages the administration and the monitoring tools of the workflow
 system.
 Through this service, the executing process should be managed, well-supervised
 and the events should be recorded in log files.

Scientific workflow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Workflow technology is established in the business domain for several years.
 This fact suggests the need for detailed investigations in the qualification
 of conventional workflow technology for the evolving application domain
 of e-Science.

\begin_layout Standard
Scientific workflows are specialized forms of workflows that are designed
 for data-intensive or knowledge-discovery applications in various scientific
 disciplines.
 Scientific workflows enable researchers to formulate, share, reuse and
 validate complex methods that involve different data sources and computational
 platforms.
\end_layout

Definition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scientific workflows are data-intensive applications representing distributed
 data sources and complex computations in various domains, i.e.
 astronomy, engineering sciences and bioinformatics.
 In distributed environments various sensors and experimental processes
 generate a large volume of data that need collection and processing within
 specific time constraints

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The life cycle of scientific workflows heavily distinguishes from its business
 counterpart (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:lifecycle"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 We inferred the life cycle from observations about the way scientists create
 and conduct experiments and from known properties of scientific simulations
 and computations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typically, there is only one user group, the scientists, playing the roles
 of a modeler, user, administrator and analyst.
 The focus of their work is usually on single workflow instances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be precise, scientists do not distinguish between workflow models and
 instances or are not aware of the difference between models and instances,
 respectively.
 They set up a simulation and execute it once at a time.
 Because scientists typically develop their workflow in a trial-and-error
 manner, modeling and execution phases are not arranged in a strict sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In fact, they can be carried out alternately.
 An additional cycle, therefore, leads from execution back to the modeling
 phase with the help of a “suspend” operation on the workflow instance,
 which remains hidden from the scientists.
 Technical details are transparent for scientists altogether.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance, conventional workflow adaptation is experienced as scientific
 workflow modeling; the deployment (of parts of a workflow) is part of the
 “run/resume” operation, which is also hidden for the scientist.
 Workflow execution starts immediately after modeling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The traditional execution and monitoring phases are merged into a single
 phase in the scientific workflow life cycle because from a scientist’s
 point of view monitoring only visualizes a running workflow (instance).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the execution, a scientist can analyze the computed results and may
 re-model and re-execute the workflow possibly with different parameters.

they contribute to sharing knowledge by being available as services for
 collaborating scientists.

with the help of workflows a community-based analysis of results is supported.
\end_layout

workflows are able to deal with huge amounts of data, e.g.
 collected by sensors or calculated by scientific algorithms.

\begin_layout Itemize
workflows are capable of running in distributed and highly heterogeneous
 environments—a common scenario in scientific computations where a great
 variety of platforms and programming languages is usually employed.

the automation of steps during workflow design and execution allows scientists
 to concentrate on solving their main scientific problems.

 workflows, which prevent the direct application of the developed adaptation
 methods

\begin_layout Itemize
Business workflows aim at automating organizational processes that are mainly
 executed by humans, while scientific workflows aim at validating the hypotheses
 of a researcher based on available data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Business workflows have a predetermined goal, while scientific workflows
 have experimental and exploratory goals that vary more frequently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Business workflows are executed under human control, while scientific workflows
 are executed fully automatically by a computer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Business workflows depend on certain resources including application programs,
 while scientific workflows depend more strongly on proper parameter settings.

\begin_layout Section
Main Requirements on scientific WfMS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Workflows in the scientific area make use of a data-centric approach.
 Typically, huge amounts of data have to be processed, e.g.
 5 GB data per day is transmitted by the Hubble telescope and probably need
 to be processed by a workflow.
 The modeling language for scientific workflows is primarily data-driven,
 sometimes with support of a few control structures (e.g.
 in Taverna, Triana).
 That means, for accommodating the scientists’ needs the main focus of the
 modeling language should be on data flow while the control flow is considered
 secondary

\begin_layout Itemize
usability: since the majority of users of WfMS are not computer scientists.
 A scientist needs the support of easy-to-use tools, automation as far as
 possible and maximal flexibility in the usage of the WfMS.This means that
 scientists want to:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
model their workflows in a convenient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
run their workflows and store their data on resources that are specified
 by the user himself or automatically chosen by the WfMS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
same support for services used in traditional workflows.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
flexible: it means the ability of a system to react to changes in its environmen
t.
 Approaches to the flexibility of workflows can be divided into two groups:
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
workflow can be modified according to the changed situation (known as adaptation
).
 Such modifications can address different workflow dimensions (logical,
 functional and organizational dimension and may be applied to workflow
 models or single workflow instances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
workflow can be modeled in a way that avoids its modification even in the
 presence of a changing environment (known as avoid change).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
monitoring: WfMS should support the ability to monitor the status of the
 workflow execution.
 For example, the scientist is interested in knowledge about running, finished
 or faulted activities, allocated resources and the dynamical choice of
 a service implementation.
 Inspecting the produced data is also a need.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
reproducibility: is of utmost importance for different reasons.
 Scientists who are not involved in the execution of the workflow need to
 be able to retrace the simulation, have to review the findings, or need
 to use the results.
 The operating scientist may want to repeat a workflow or parts of it to
 draw conclusions and to prove statements and assumptions.
 Additionally, the scientist may share the results with people he collaborates
 with.
 While following and reproducing workflow runs and their (intermediate)
 results scientists use provenance information.
 Finally, provenance information should be displayed in a way that (non-computer
) scientists understand the execution of workflows including the derivation
 of data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
• robustness: this is an important issue since scientific workflows are
 long-running.
 The term robustness denotes the ability to be error-resistant.
 The needed flexibility mechanisms mentioned above are a way to improve
 the robustness of a system.
 But additional approaches are needed to protect the execution progress
 from being lost in case of unforeseeable failures, to reach a consistent
 system state even in the presence of failures and to proceed with a simulation/
experiment after a failure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
• scalability: scientific workflows should scale with the number of users,
 number of utilized services, data or calculation resources and involved
 participants.
 Today, typical scientific workflows are mostly executed in a central manner
 on a single machine.
 A decentralized workflow enactment can help to scale via distributed process
 execution.
 It can be achieved, for example, by parallel execution in distributed and
 heterogeneous execution environments using provisioning techniques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
• specific requirements: there are specific requirements for each specific
 scientific domain, e.g.
 life science, medical science, chemistry or mechanical engineering.
 Specific domain-related requirements and the fact that it is hard to cover
 all scientific domains in one WfMS create the need to extend WfMS and the
 workflow models and possibly adapt these models and their instances.
 This includes, for example, domain-specific services, result displays or
 meta-models for semantic annotations.
