Cloud computing is a distributed heterogeneous computing model providing
 many services through the Internet without the violation of Service level
 agreement (SLA).
 The Cloud services are provided as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
 Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS).
 Cloud computing power is supplied by a collection of data centers (DCs)
 that are typically installed with massive hosts (physical servers).
 These hosts are transparently managed by the virtualization services that
 allow sharing of their capacities among virtual instances of servers (VMS)

In addition, the advent of Cloud computing has another advantage over the
 massive spread of scientific work.
 Scientific workflow refers to a series of computations that enable data
 analysis in a distributed and systematic way; because this workflow has
 a large number of works, energy consumption is a major problem

 However, the execution of scientific workflows needs a huge amount of data
 or allocates enormous computing resources and big scalability.

The energy consumption of Cloud data centers is an important challenge.
 Energy consumption is increasing day by day due to a non-energy-aware strategy
 in resource management.
 About 0.5% of energy consumption worldwide is related to Cloud data centers,
 while this is envisaged to be fourfold in 2020

In general, workflow application-oriented energy-aware scheduling in Clouds
 involves mapping tasks to resources, arranging tasksâ€™ execution order and
 assigning appropriate task execution time, such as optimizing energy consumptio
n and satisfying complex constraints.
 It is an NP-complete problem and has been researched extensively in the
 literature

Our objective consists of developing a tool for scheduling workflows on
 the Cloud using the technique of multiple partitioning of scientific workflows
 for multi-criteria optimization of planning execution while reducing the
 energy consumption of this solution.

The structure of this thesis is as follows: In Chapter 1, we provide an
 overview of the Cloud computing infrastructure that we use for our project.
 In Chapter 2, we describe the workflow technology and the scientific workflow.
 In Chapter 3, we formulate the problem of scheduling the scientific workflows
 with energy optimization as our main criterion.
 In Chapter 4, we propose and design our novel approach to solving the problem.
 In Chapter 5, we implement, simulate and evaluate our approach and discuss
 the results and findings.
